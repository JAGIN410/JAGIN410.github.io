                    <p>
                        I recently had the opportunity to work on a project for the Robotics and Autonomous Systems minor program at the University of Maryland.
                        The project involved designing a pick and place task using a UR3e robot arm. I was responsible for programming the robot arm to pick up
                        objects from a designated point in the camera fram and place them on top of one another. I used ROS2 and Python to develop the robot's motion planning and control.
                        The project required a deep understanding of kinematics, dynamics, and control theory, as well as proficiency in ROS2 and Python programming. 
                        I'm proud of the final product and the positive feedback we received from our peers and professor.

                    <p>
                        As a member of a five-person team in the ENES100 course at the University of Maryland, I designed and built an Over Terrain Vehicle (OTV) for a semester-long project. 
                        The OTV was required to navigate a series of obstacles and challenges, including a ramp, a seesaw, and a slalom course. I was responsible for designing the OTV's chassis and 
                        suspension system, as well as programming the Arduino-based control system. I used SolidWorks to design the chassis and Autodesk Inventor to design the suspension system. 
                        I also programmed the Arduino to control the OTV's motors and servos, enabling it to navigate the course autonomously. The project required extensive collaboration and communication 
                        among team members, as well as proficiency in mechanical design and programming.

                    <p>
                        As part of the NASA HUNCH program, I worked with a team of students to design and build a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the International Space Station (ISS). 
                        The GUI was designed to enable astronauts to monitor and control various systems on the ISS, including life support, power, and communications. I was responsible for 
                        designing the GUI's layout and functionality, as well as programming the interface using Python and PyQt. I also worked with the team to integrate the GUI with the 
                        ISS's existing systems, ensuring compatibility and reliability. The project required a deep understanding of human-computer interaction and user interface design, as well 
                        as proficiency in Python programming and GUI development. Our team placed 4th in the NASA HUNCH competition.

                        I was team lead of a group students to design and build a mobile app for the Maryland Emergency Shelter 
                        Association (MESA). The app was designed to enable MESA volunteers to coordinate and communicate during emergency shelter operations, including check-in, check-out, 
                        and resource allocation. I was responsible for designing the app's user interface and functionality, as well as programming the app using Kotlin. 
                        I also worked with the team to integrate the app with MESA's existing systems, ensuring compatibility and reliability. The project required a deep understanding of 
                        mobile app development and user experience design, as well as proficiency in React Native programming and Firebase integration. Our team received positive feedback from 
                        MESA volunteers and staff, and the app is currently in use during emergency shelter operations.
