                    <p>
                        I recently had the opportunity to work on an impactful project aimed at streamlining course delivery and support for UNIV100. 
                        Our team successfully designed and implemented a comprehensive asynchronous training program for instructors and coordinators, 
                        which included flexible syllabus customization and ongoing support. By facilitating virtual check-ins and offering a Question 
                        Line through Google Surveys, we ensured that all participants had access to the resources they needed for effective course implementation. 
                        This project not only improved consistency and clarity in course delivery but also fostered collaboration and adaptability among team 
                        members. It was rewarding to see the positive outcomes and to contribute to enhancing the learning experience for students.

                        MPEC Watch is a web application that provides astronomers with valuable insights into minor planet data. Using Python, SQL, and 
                        Bootstrap, I developed a tool that queries a large SQL database and generates informative visualizations. The project focuses on 
                        individual station observatory browsers, where I'm responsible for creating user-friendly interfaces using Bootstrap. I've overcome 
                        challenges related to data cleaning and visualization, implementing efficient SQL queries and leveraging Matplotlib for data plotting.
                        In the future, I plan to expand MPEC Watch to include additional features such as real-time data updates and more advanced analysis tools.

                        As the leader of a five-member hackathon team, I spearheaded the development of an Arduino-based 
                        heartbeat simulator. This interactive educational tool uses LEDs within a 3D-printed heart model to visually represent a beating heart. 
                        A remote control allows users to adjust the heart rate via an IR receiver, providing a tangible and engaging experience while providing descriptors
                        of the heart rate based on heigh, weight, and age. The project required extensive collaboration and communication among team members, as well as
                        proficiency in Arduino programming and circuit design. I'm proud of the final product and the positive feedback we received from our peers.

                    <p>
                        During my research at the University of Texas at Austin, I developed an efficient image labeling tool to streamline 
                        the identification of methane super-emitters from satellite imagery. This tool leverages the Google Maps API to 
                        query nearby locations based on satellite image coordinates (longitude/latitude), enabling intuitive labeling of 
                        unmarked emitters. A key feature is its ability to batch images by geoproximity, allowing users to label clusters of 
                        emitters in nearby areas, significantly speeding up the process. Labeled images are stored in a custom-designed database 
                        for easy access, analysis, and future use.
                        <br><br>
                        In addition to increasing efficiency, the tool supports scalability for larger datasets, making it adaptable for broader 
                        environmental monitoring and research applications. I also worked with machine learning researchers to use the labeled 
                        images for training a convolutional neural network (CNN), which achieved an accuracy of approximately 83% in identifying 
                        methane super-emitter hotspots. The scientific community recognized my work, and I presented my findings at the American 
                        Geophysical Union (AGU) 2024 conference in Washington, D.C. on December 7th. This tool has the potential for wide 
                        application in tracking methane emissions, contributing to efforts to combat climate change.
